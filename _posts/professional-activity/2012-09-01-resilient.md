The RESILIENT project aims at designing, developing, installing and assessing the energy and environmental benefits of a new integrated concept of interconnectivity between buildings, DER, grids and other networks at a district level. The RESILIENT approach will combine different innovative technologies including smart ICT components, optimized energy generation and storage technologies, also for RES, integrated to provide real time view  of energy demand and supply at a district level and support decision-making processes.

My team at CSTB was in charge of the platform integration. I built a n-tiers architecture based on REST web services to allow communication between the different softwares involved plus a network optimization engine based on genetic algorithms.
