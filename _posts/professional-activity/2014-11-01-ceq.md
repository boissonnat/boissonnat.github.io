The France has been choose to welcome the next [2015 climat conference](http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/politique-etrangere-de-la-france/climat/conference-paris-climat-2015-cop21/). 

One point of this conference will be to show the impact of the energy efficency neighbourhood. In order to achieve 
this goal, the CSTB has developed a complete methodology allowing the EcoDistrict evaluation. A web application has 
been developed in order to hide the methodology's complexity and help local collectivities to follow it. 

I was in charge of the development team. We have constantly focus our energy to improve the user experience. 
With agility, we have develop the application in parallel with the methodoly definition to help experts to work on 
concret things. 'keep it simple' and 'Don't repeat yourself' was our succes keys to refactoring everywhere anytime.
