With my new consultancy activity I need to track my time with precision. I also have the need to be able to report my activity
to all the different people around me. 

In a few days I wrote a first working version of TticTtac which handles my primary needs. It's up on heroku, absolutly 
free, give it a try !

We also manage a Trello board, don't hesitate to drop me an email to be part of it if you want to see someday
your favorites features in TticTtac.
