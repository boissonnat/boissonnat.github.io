IDEAS "Intelligent Neighbourhood Energy Allocation & Supervision" is a R&D project supported by the European Commission,
focused on the development and operation of energy positive neighbourhoods. In addition, IDEAS focuses on the economic 
and environmental benefits of doing so.

IDEAS develops and validates different tools and business models needed for demonstrating the cost-effective and 
incremental implementation of an energy positive neighbourhood. The neighbourhood energy management tool enables 
intelligent energy trading and operation of equipment and buildings along with local energy generation and storage.

My team was in chagre of the development of user interfaces that engage communities and individuals in the operation of 
Energy Positive Neighbourhoods. I was responsible for the whole development process from conception to deployment.
