SWOP is an EC funded R&D project which I was working on. It aims to provide an Open, Standards-based platform for 
products and processes optimization.

The team at CSTB is in charge of designing and implementing the Genetic Algorithm Engine. This module handles 
optimization of complex product configurations (manufacturing, supply chain, construction processes, etc.) via 
Evolutionary runs, based on Product Data which is expressed using the latest Semantic Web technologies from W3C.

We also lead the design and implementation of an Eclipse plug-in which allows the integrators of the SWOP platform to 
generate new end-users applications which depend on their concerns and a front-end, a web-based portal that allows 
end-users to access the features of the SWOP platform.
