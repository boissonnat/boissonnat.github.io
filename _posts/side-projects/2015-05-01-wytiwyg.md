wy-T-iwyg stands for What You Type is What You Get. This is a basic document sharing platform, built over a powerful markdown editor with a full real-time rendering.

The front-end is entirely managed with AngularJS (giving a try to AngularJS was actually my main motivation for working on this project)
just after the boring registration stuff, while Ruby on Rails takes care of the business model.

I'm thinking about dropping AngularJS and transform this _POC_ in ruby gem for markdown edition.
