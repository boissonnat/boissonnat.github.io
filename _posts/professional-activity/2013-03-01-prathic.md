Prathic-ERP is a platform which references products that meet the needs of disabled people in institutions receiving public. 
This site was created at the initiative of the Ministerial Delegation for Accessibility. The Information and Advice 
Centre for Assistive Technology (CEP-CICAT) with its operation by managing memberships manufacturers and organizing 
the publishing committee. A complex publishing workflow has been perform to ensure the quality of the publications 
and the pertinence of the products.

On top of this complex workflow we have built simple interfaces for both manufacturers and public. I was deeply 
involved in each part of the project, from the product definition to the deployment. I have organized the development 
process with agility and lead the development team. We have released since 2013 three majors versions.
