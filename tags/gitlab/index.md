We started by hosting our own GitLab at my work. We use it for professional purpose on every project. I like so much the simplicity
og this tool.
Then I switched my personal projects from BitBucket to GitLab.com.

These guys from GitLab made an amazing work ! I will not be surprise if one day they beat GitHub.
