To reduce operating costs and energy consumption in commercial buildings, to develop the market of services in the 
field of building, these are the objectives of the project SmartImmo Pole SCS.

The role of CSTB in this project is to define a building reference which provides both general knowledge about building 
a simple model based on the IFC which can be enriched up by the information produced by sensors and a whole service for 
handling such data.

I am involved in specification and design, and as a technical advisor for the development team. This application is built 
over an n-tier architecture, providing first a data model, then a set of Web services allowing other applications to 
communicate with the repository and building and finally providing both web application and rich client front-end used 
to interface with users.
