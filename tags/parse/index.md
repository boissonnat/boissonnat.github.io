Parse is probably the most known Backend as a service (BaaS) platform. It provides tons of amazing features (mainly their 13 SDKs) allowing you 
to focus on client application from the first second. 

You can find a lot of info about BaaS platform through your favorite search engine, but
I recommend you to clearly define a migration plan at the very beginning in case your architecture evolves.
