Using the IoC pattern is more or less mandatory as soon as you will start developing big application. 
Even if we have removed Spring dependencies from the woko code base (for flexibility purpose), it remains one of the 
best IoC framework around.

When I talk about Spring here, I means mainly the IoC implementation but sometimes it's about SpringRCP (for desktop app) or SpringMVC.
