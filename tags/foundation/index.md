The problem with [Bootstrap](/tags/bootstrap) when you use it like as it comes,is that all your projects look alike !

This is why I tried Foundation sometimes. But even if Foundation is great, it comes with less components than Bootstrap. 
This is why I prefer Bootstrap to Foundation but as soon as we'll recruit a designer, I promise to reconsider my choice :).
