Capistrano is a remote server automation and deployment tool written in Ruby.

I use it to provide [continuous delivery](tags/continuous-delivery) on every [Ruby on Rails](/tags/ruby-on-rails) projects
where I cannot use an hosting cloud solution. It is a very powerful tool, easy to configure and very well documented.
