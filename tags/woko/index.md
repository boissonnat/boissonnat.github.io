[Woko](http://woko.pojosontheweb.com/) is a Full-Stack, Domain-Driven Web Framework for the Java platform. It builds upon strong foundations and mixes 
in unique concepts, providing a developer experience that ain't so common in the Java landscape.

We are pragmatic, and we eat our own dog food. We try to make it simple and effective, just as it should be. 

I'm contributor since 2011 and member of the [Woko team](http://www.pojosontheweb.com) since its creation.
