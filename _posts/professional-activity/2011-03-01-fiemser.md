The main objective of this project is the development of an innovative energy management system for existing and new 
residential buildings(BEMS), which pursues the increase of the efficiency of the energy used and the reduction of the global 
energy demand of the building, but without penalizing the comfort levels of the users.

I was in charge of the data platform development. The main goal of this platform is to collect save and share all the
data exchanged between each module. My principal challenge in this project was to coordinate the development of each
module in order to ensure the global integration.
