## About this website

The purpose of this website is mainly to keep a trace of my work, to share knowledge and experience with my pairs and why not to
catch the eyes of recruiters. I built it with [Jekyll](/tags/jekyll) around my [technology radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/build-your-own-technology-radar?utm_campaign=technology-radar&utm_medium=email&utm_source=marketo&mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonv6%2FIcO%2FhmjTEU5z16e8qUa6yiokz2EFye%2BLIHETpodcMTcZnNbnYDBceEJhqyQJxPr3EJdkNy9F4RhPrCQ%3D%3D)
using only posts and tags.
