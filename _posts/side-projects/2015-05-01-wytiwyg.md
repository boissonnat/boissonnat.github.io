wy-T-iwyg stands for What You Type is What You Get. This is a basic platform for sharing documents built over a 
powerful markdown editor with a fully real-time rendering.

The front-end is entirely manage with AngularJS (giving a try to AngularJS stayed my first motivation to this project) 
just after the boring registration stuff while Ruby on Rails takes care of the business model.

I'm thinking about dropping AngularJS and transform this _POC_ in ruby gem for markdown edition.
