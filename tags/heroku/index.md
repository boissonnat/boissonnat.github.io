Heroku is a beautifully simple Platform as a Service (PaaS). Although Heroku began as a Ruby on Rails platform, it is 
evolving to support a variety of languages and web frameworks. Heroku uses a standard stack and 
deploys applications with a simple Git push.

Be able to deploy application by a simple ```git push``` is just amazing mostly in the [continuous delivery](/tags/continuous-delivery)'s field.
 
Heroku provides great features and I use it each times it's possible.
