# About

## I'm a Full-stack web developer

Developer by passion with specific skills in client-server applications, and a strong background in 
software engineering in general. Engaged throughout the whole software development process, constantly focusing on 
the user's satisfaction by providing efficient solutions in software design and implementation.

Currently involved, as technical leader, in several projects and consultancy activities, I am looking for a 
challenging position in an Agile development team highly motivated and offering opportunities for career advancement.

## About this website

This website exists mainly to keep a trace of my work, to share knowledge and experience with my pairs and why not to
catch eyes of recruiters. I built it with [Jekyll](/tags/jekyll) around my [technology radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/build-your-own-technology-radar?utm_campaign=technology-radar&utm_medium=email&utm_source=marketo&mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonv6%2FIcO%2FhmjTEU5z16e8qUa6yiokz2EFye%2BLIHETpodcMTcZnNbnYDBceEJhqyQJxPr3EJdkNy9F4RhPrCQ%3D%3D)
using only posts and tags.
