ALCATRA is an application which allows a lessor to characterize the accessibility for the housings, the common areas and the buildings 
according to a ranking DPE like (Classes A to F) based on five disabilities: seniors, wheelchair, auditory, visual and cognitive.

The key of this application stands in a mechanism allowing experts to build complex dynamic decision trees.
I am in charge of the whole development process of the application from the conception to the deployment. 

The first release has been deployed in Oct. 15th, 2015. I am now focused on the mobile app development (iOS, Android).

### Resources

The application is available here: [www.alcatra.fr](http://www.alcatra.fr), but only for our customers.
