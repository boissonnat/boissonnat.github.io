It seems like _Agility_ became a buzzword used by marketing people to win contracts.

I totally disagree with this approach, _Agility_ is key in software development. Each time you face a choice, you need to 
take the “agile” decision. I deal with _Agility_ all the time.

I use a lot of methods from XP like code review, peer programing, TDD, etc… I also dove into the Scrum framework, 
sometimes with success, sometimes with failures. Thanks to  Kanban I discover the lean software development and I think it's the perfect fit to software development

- You will not spend half of your time in meetings
- You can change the process depending on your needs (project, team, …)
- You can improve it along the way

Mixed with efficient XP methods you are able to provide great softwares. 
I did not tag any project with ```#agile``` because all of them have been developed in an agile way.
