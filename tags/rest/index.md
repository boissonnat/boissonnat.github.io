__REST__ stands for Representational State Transfer and is the software architectural style of the World Wide Web.
REST gives a coordinated set of constraints to the design of components in a distributed hypermedia system that can 
lead to a higher-performing and more maintainable architecture.

I was in charge of several integration platforms based on REST approach.
