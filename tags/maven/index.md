Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model 
(POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

Every one of my java projects are built over Maven. I also dove deeper inside Maven, in order to develop my own plugins.
