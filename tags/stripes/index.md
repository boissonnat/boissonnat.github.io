The best Web MVC for Java. Hands down.
It's compact, elegant, effective and fun to use. It has everything you need in order to build webapps :

- Kick-ass Data Binding & Validation
- Neat Controller model (ActionBeans)
- HTML Tag library (FORMs)
- Fully extensible

We built [Woko](/tags/woko) on it and used them so many times.
