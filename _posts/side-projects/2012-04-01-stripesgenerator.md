Stripes is the best Web MVC for Java. Hands down.
It's compact, elegant, effective and fun to use. It has everything you need in order to build webapps:
Kick-ass Data Binding & Validation, 
Neat Controller model (ActionBeans),
HTML Tag library (FORMs),
Fully extensible.

I wrote this Groovy Script to speed up Stripes apps bootstrapping. By answering a few questions, this command line
tool will generate a working 'Hello World' app with your exact needs.
