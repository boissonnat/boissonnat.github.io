_Envm_ is an environment manager based on maven for Java projects. 
This is a fork of the woko [maven plugin](https://github.com/pojosontheweb/woko/tree/develop/wmaven) 
where we've just remove the dependencies on [Woko framework](http://www.pojosontheweb.com/).

_Envm_ allow to have different resources depending on the context (e.g. production, test, dev, etc.). 
They are plain folders under the project root :

{% highlight bash %}
* MyApp/
    environments/
        dev/
            log4j.properties
            hibernate.cfg.xml
        prod/
            log4j.properties
            hibernate.cfg.xml
{% endhighlight %}

You can switch from various environments easily by using :

{% highlight bash %}
$> mvn clean install -Denvm.env=dev
{% endhighlight %}

The plugin will recursively copy (and thereby possibly overwrite existing resources) the files found in 
the environment folder ```<project_root>/environments/myenv``` to the ```target/classes``` folder of your project.
